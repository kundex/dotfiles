# Custom configurations (aka dotfiles) for some FOSS GNU/Linux applications I use 
### Containing only the best:
- Browser (qutebrowser)
- File Manager (broot & vifm)
- Mail Reader (neomutt)
- Media Player (mpv)
- PDF Viewer (zathura)
- RSS reader (newsboat)
- Shell (fish)
- Statusbar (polybar)
- System Info (neofetch)
- Text Editor (vim)
- Tiling Window Manager (herbstluftwm)

- ...we'll see what comes next :-) 

### So my tiling window manager coding workspace looks like this:

![my_desktop](desktop.png?raw=true "vim and vifm")
![my_desktop](desktop2.jpg?raw=true "fish shell, mpv, qutebrowser and newsboat")
